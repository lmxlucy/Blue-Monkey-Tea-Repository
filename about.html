        <h3>Blue Monkey Tea</h3>
        <div id="logo"><img src="images/logo.png" alt="logo"/></div>
        <p>
            Opened in October 2002, Blue Monkey Tea is a specialty tea store 
            located in Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
            The tea shop features over 400 varieties of teas, a huge assortment 
            of teapots and tea gadgets, and international sweets. In addition, 
            we also offer tea classes and tea tastings every month. 
        </p><br>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            The original store was established in May of 2002. 
            
            It was named Wicks & Beans, as the original merchandise consisted 
            
            mostly of scented candles and coffee beans. 
            
            We were located at 2207 Murray Ave, also in Squirrel Hill (down and 
            
            across from Mineo's Pizza.)

            Despite the small space, we expanded our assortments, eventually 
            
            also selling teas and international sweets. 
            
            Well, it was getting tight, so we were very happy to move to a much 
            
            larger space at 5872 Forbes Ave in July of 2006 and change the name 
            
            of the store to Margaret's Fine Imports.

            Since then we've become mostly a Tea Specialty store with over 400 
            
            varieties of teas in stock, and a huge assortment of teapots and tea
            
            gadgets. We even sell items like tea cozies and tea wallets!

            We offer Tea Classes and Tea Tastings every month. We also carry 
            
            over 30 types of coffee beans and some neat coffee makers!

            Apart from that we also attend to the sweet tooth of our customers 
            
            by stocking up on international sweets, especially around Holidays.

            We offer excellent service and we enjoy interacting with our 
            
            customers: repeat and new!

            On May 9th, 2017 we opened a store in Carnegie and changed both 
            
            store names to Blue Monkey Tea. The Carnegie PA location moved 
            
            to Pittsburgh in February of 2019.

            Whose a good Blue Monkey Tea? We are a good Blue Monkey Tea! And 
            
            we are here to serve you! We changed our name, in an attempt, 
            
            to brand ourselves nationwide.

        <h3>Margaret Harris, Owner:</h3>
        <p>
            Margaret Harris is the owner of Blue Monkey Tea, tea & gourmet food 
            
            store in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
            
            As one of Pittsburgh's primary tea experts, Margaret Harris is a tea
            
            consultant and regularly conducts classes and workshops on tea at a 
            
            variety of venues, including colleges, clubs, associations, 
            
            corporations, and at her store. As a native of Poland, where tea is 
            
            the primary household beverage, her lifelong experience with tea 
            
            began quite early: she may have had her first "cup of tea" when she 
            
            was only one day old! Margaret is a graduate of the Warsaw Medical 
            
            College, which has enabled her to incorporate her medical knowledge 
            
            into her teachings on the health aspects of teas and tisanes. 
            
            Margaret is a founding member of the Western Pennsylvania Tea 
            
            Business Association, as well as several other business and 
            
            professional groups.

            Blue Monkey Tea was called Margaret's Fine Imports and before that 
            
            Wicks and Beans.
